## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

Main Data
```{r}
#imports data
box.office <- read.csv(file = 'movieData.csv', header = TRUE, fill = TRUE)
```

```{r}
#removes all movies with box offices of 0
row_sub = apply(box.office[6:7], 1, function(row) !any(row==0) )
cleaner <- box.office[row_sub,]
rownames(cleaner) <- NULL
```

Clean Images Data
```{r}
images <- read.csv(file = 'MovieToMovieImage.csv', header = TRUE, fill = TRUE)
images <- subset(images, select=c(1, 2))
write.csv(images, file = 'clean_images.csv')

```

```{r}
write.csv(cleaner, file = 'clean_movies.csv')

```

Scraper
```{r}
scraper <- cleaner[ , c(1, 4)]
write.csv(scraper, file = 'scraper.csv')
```

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
data <- read.csv(file = 'tmdb_5000_movies.csv', header = TRUE, fill = TRUE)
```

names <- data[ , c(4,18)]
write.csv(names, file = "names.csv")

```

production.companies <- data[ , c(4, 10)]
write.csv(production.companies, file = "production_companies.csv")
```

```{r}
credits <- read.csv(file = 'tmdb_5000_credits.csv', header = TRUE, fill = TRUE)

```
```{r}
cast <- credits[ , c(1, 3)]
crew <- credits[ , c(1, 4)]
write.csv(cast, file = "cast.csv")
write.csv(crew, file = "crew.csv")

```
